   This configuration file must be located strictly in the following
directory so that the server application folder correctly
retrieves data from this JSON file. If you want to change the location
of this folder, you should go to server_core/include/ServerCore.h
and change the PATH_TO_JSON constant. The same situation is with the
client, only the path changes in client_run/client.cpp.

Required configuration for the client:
    serverPort
    localIpAddress

Required configuration for the server:
    serverPort
    localIpAddress
    users
